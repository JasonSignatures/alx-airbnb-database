üßæ Normalization Review of Schema
1. USER Table

Proposed structure:

User(
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  address VARCHAR(255),
  date_joined DATE
)

‚úÖ Review:

Each field is atomic ‚Üí satisfies 1NF.

No composite keys ‚Üí 2NF automatically satisfied.

All attributes depend only on the key (user_id) ‚Üí no transitive dependency.
‚úÖ 3NF compliant.

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issue:

If you also store city and country within User, and these same values repeat across many users, you may introduce redundancy.

Fix:
Create a Location table:

Location(
  location_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  city VARCHAR(100),
  country VARCHAR(100)
)

-- then
User(location_id INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Location(location_id))

2. PROPERTY Table

Proposed structure:

Property(
  property_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  owner_id INT,
  property_name VARCHAR(100),
  description TEXT,
  location VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  property_type VARCHAR(50)
)

‚ö†Ô∏è Review:

All columns atomic ‚Üí 1NF ‚úÖ

No composite key ‚Üí 2NF ‚úÖ

Possible violation of 3NF:
If owner_id refers to a user and you also store owner details here (e.g., owner_name, owner_email), those fields depend on owner_id, not directly on property_id.

Fix:
Remove those attributes and ensure they live in the User table:

ALTER TABLE Property
DROP COLUMN owner_name,
DROP COLUMN owner_email;


‚úÖ After fix, Property depends only on its primary key ‚Äî 3NF satisfied.

3. BOOKING Table

Proposed structure:

Booking(
  booking_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  property_id INT,
  booking_date DATE,
  check_in DATE,
  check_out DATE,
  total_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  status VARCHAR(50)
)

‚úÖ Review:

Each field atomic ‚Üí 1NF ‚úÖ

Non-key fields depend on the whole primary key (booking_id) ‚Üí 2NF ‚úÖ

No field depends on another non-key field (e.g., total_price should be computed but not stored redundantly).
‚úÖ 3NF compliant.

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issue:

If you store both property_price and total_price here, it creates redundancy (price is derived from Property and duration).
Fix: Keep only total_price or calculate it dynamically using joins.

4. PAYMENT Table

Proposed structure:

Payment(
  payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id INT,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  method VARCHAR(50),
  payment_date DATE,
  status VARCHAR(50)
)

‚úÖ Review:

Each column atomic ‚Üí 1NF ‚úÖ

Non-key attributes depend only on payment_id ‚Üí 2NF ‚úÖ

No transitive dependency (e.g., don‚Äôt include user_email or property_name here).
‚úÖ 3NF compliant.

5. POTENTIAL REDUNDANCIES (Summary Table)
Table	Violation	Description	Normalization Fix
User	None (possible location redundancy)	Repeated city/country values	Create Location table
Property	3NF	Owner details depend on owner_id	Move to User table
Booking	Derived data redundancy	Storing both property and total price	Calculate or remove redundant field
Payment	None	All dependencies correct	Keep as-is
‚úÖ Conclusion

After review:

User, Booking, and Payment are in 3NF.

Property needed minor adjustment (removing owner info redundancy).

Optionally, User location data can be normalized further.

Your schema now fully satisfies Third Normal Form (3NF) ‚Äî ensuring minimal redundancy and strong data integrity.
User(user_id, name, email, phone, role_id)
Property(property_id, owner_id, name, price, location)
...
# üìò Database Normalization Process (Up to 3NF)

## üéØ Objective
To refine the database schema by removing redundancy and ensuring data integrity through normalization up to the **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.

---

## üß© 1. Understanding Normalization
**Normalization** is the process of structuring a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data consistency.  
Each *normal form* adds rules to achieve a cleaner, more efficient design.

---

## üß± 2. Normalization Steps

### ü•á Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
**Rule:**  
- Each table cell must contain a single (atomic) value.  
- Each record must be unique.

**Action Taken:**  
- Split multi-valued attributes (e.g., multiple phone numbers ‚Üí separate rows or table).  
- Added **primary keys** to each table (`user_id`, `property_id`, `booking_id`, `payment_id`).

**Example:**
| user_id | full_name | phone_numbers |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1        | Jane Doe   | 0801, 0812    |

‚û° **After 1NF**
| user_id | first_name | last_name | phone_number |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 1        | Jane        | Doe        | 0801          |
| 1        | Jane        | Doe        | 0812          |

‚úÖ **Result:** Each column now holds atomic values; duplicates removed.

---

### ü•à Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
**Rule:**  
- Must already satisfy **1NF**.  
- All non-key attributes must depend on the *whole* primary key (no partial dependency).

**Action Taken:**  
- Identified composite keys and removed partial dependencies.  
- Moved attributes that depended only on part of a composite key into separate tables.

**Example (Violation):**
Here, `property_location` depends only on `property_id`, not the composite key.

‚û° **Fix:** Move `property_location` to the `Property` table.

‚úÖ **Result:** Each non-key attribute fully depends on the entire primary key.

---

### ü•â Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
**Rule:**  
- Must already satisfy **2NF**.  
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes).

**Action Taken:**  
- Removed transitive dependencies such as `owner_email` depending on `owner_id`.  
- Created a `User` (or `Owner`) table to hold those details.

**Example (Violation):**
Here, `owner_email` depends on `owner_id`, not directly on `property_id`.

‚û° **Fix:**  
Move `owner_email` to the `User` table and link using a foreign key:

‚úÖ **Result:** All non-key attributes now depend *only* on the table‚Äôs primary key.

---

## üßÆ 3. Final 3NF Schema Overview

| Entity   | Primary Key | Key Attributes | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **User** | user_id | first_name, last_name, email, phone | Each user uniquely identified |
| **Property** | property_id | owner_id (FK), name, location, price, type | No redundant owner data |
| **Booking** | booking_id | user_id (FK), property_id (FK), booking_date, check_in, check_out, total_price, status | Fully dependent on booking_id |
| **Payment** | payment_id | booking_id (FK), amount, method, payment_date, status | Linked directly to booking |

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Benefits of 3NF
- Eliminates redundant data storage  
- Prevents update, insertion, and deletion anomalies  
- Improves data consistency  
- Simplifies maintenance and querying  

---

## üèÅ 5. Conclusion
After applying normalization up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
- Each table stores a single, well-defined concept.  
- All non-key attributes depend directly on the primary key.  
- The schema is free of partial and transitive dependencies.  

This ensures a **clean, efficient, and reliable** database design.
